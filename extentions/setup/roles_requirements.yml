#
# Requirements file is used to keep track of ansible role origins and versions
# source code of roles is thus checked into the apphome-ansible repo, but we have an easy way to
# update role dependencies.
#
# This means you should *NOT* update the code of third-party roles inside this repo,
# instead make a pull request to them or download your fork of that version.
#
#
#
# REQUIRES ANSIBLE version 1.8+
#
# To update external roles run: ./role_update.sh
#       Please note if the processes fails for some reason to comit or push your code
#        until you resolved the issue. if not this might break the build
#
# for syntax see docs at http://docs.ansible.com/galaxy.html#advanced-control-over-role-requirements-files
